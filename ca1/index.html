		<h2>About me</h2>
		
		
		<P>Hello, my name is Wayne and I was born and raised in Dublin. I am 44 years old and now live in Drogheda with my wife Nicky and two children Saoirse and Calum. My daughter Saoirse is 24 years old and my son Calum is 16. I've been living in Drogheda since 2005.   </P>

		<h2>Interests</h2>
		
		<p>I enjoy keepimg active and use a few different ways to try and keep myself fit. I cycle a lot, or as much as the weather allows but also enjoy weight training. I have a huge interest in sports, but in particular rugby which I played for many years until injury stopped me. I played for two clubs, the first was Clontarf RFC just outside Dublin City Centre and the second was Skerries RFC in North County Dublin. I also enjoy travelling, reading and going to the cinema.	</p>

		<h2>Hopes for the future</h2>	

		<p>I hope to complete my degree in DKIT and persue a successful career in the I.T. indusry, ideally leading to working abroad which would tie in with my love of travelling.</p>
